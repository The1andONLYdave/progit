# Making Ebooks

On Fedora (16 and later) you can run something like this::

    $ yum install ruby calibre rubygems ruby-devel rubygem-ruby-debug rubygem-rdiscount
    $ makeebooks en  # will produce a mobi

On MacOS you can do like this::
	
1. INSTALL ruby and rubygems
2. `$ gem install rdiscount`
3. DOWNLOAD Calibre for MacOS and install command line tools. You'll need some dependencies to generate a PDF:
    * pandoc: http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html
    * xelatex: http://tug.org/mactex/
4. `$ makeebooks zh` #will produce a mobi

## Notes on pandoc

Please use Pandoc version 1.11.1 or later as older versions(confirmed on 1.9.1.1) has a [bug](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/964) which hides a word after tilde `~`.  You can do `pandoc -v` to see which version you have installed.

# Errata

If you see anything that is technically wrong or otherwise in need of
correction, please [open an issue](https://github.com/progit/progit/issues/new) and one of the maintainers will take a look.

and send a pull request.

# Sending a pull request

* Be careful to use UTF-8 encoding in your files.

* If your pull request changes a translation, prefix your pull request and commits'messages with the ISO 639 code, e.g. `[de] Update chapter 2`. Please only push files where there is already some translation done.
